# Detonator Project

## Let's describe the project with an example

- The *LCD screen* asks to encode the password.
- I enter the password.
- If the password is correct, the system needs that I switch on the switch. Otherwise, it displays the password is incorrect.
- Once the switch got turned on, the countdown start from 9 to 0.
- At 0, the bomb exploses.
